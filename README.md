# Scriptsetu - Bharat Script Transliteration App

## Problem Statement

Bharat has always been a land of many languages flourishing together. The multitude of scripts have thrived and have been instrumental in the preservation of knowledge without losing continuity. Today, many people are not able to read signboards in local languages due to their inability to read a different script.

The challenge is to develop an app that can **transliterate** (Not translate) any script of Bharat into another script. For example:
- A person from Andhra Pradesh must be able to read the road signs in Gurmukhi when traveling in Punjab
- A pilgrim visiting Thiruvananthapuram from Manipur should be able to read the signs in Malayalam through a transliteration app

## Solution

Scriptsetu is a mobile application that enables seamless transliteration between various Indian scripts, breaking down language barriers while preserving the original meaning and context.

## Features

- Real-time transliteration between Indian scripts
- Camera-based text detection and transliteration
- User profile for preferred language settings
- Offline functionality for common transliterations
- Intuitive UI/UX designed for all age groups

## Tech Stack

- React Native (Expo)
